### 👋 Hey there, I’m Tchesco Ayih!

Powered by Power Platform.

🏅 Microsoft MVP | 🎤 Power Platform Speaker | 💬 Community Advocate  
🧩 Builder of apps, breaker of bugs, and occasional debugger of life itself.

#### What I do:
- 🎨 I design **beautiful Power Apps canvas apps** and craft **stunning Power Pages** (formerly Power Apps Portals) — UI matters!
- 💡 I build smart business solutions with **Power Apps**, **Power Automate**, **Dataverse**, and **Copilot Studio**.
- 🌍 I speak at events, host sessions, and ask “Can everyone hear me?” more often than I should.
- ✍️ I blog in **English and French** to share what I know and learn about Power Platform.
- 🎥 I create **YouTube tutorials** that make Power Platform approachable (and even fun, imagine that).
